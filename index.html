<h1 class="name">About Uma Maheswari</h1>
<p>I am from India, from a southern state called Tamil Nadu . 
I moved to the United States and my husband and my daughter seven years ago. 
I graduated in my country with Bachelors’s in Computer Science, and also I have a Diploma in Civil Engineering.
 I love to spend time with my family and volunteer to teach my native language to children who emigrated from my state to the US.

After a long gap, I wanted to pursue my master’s, and I enrolled in a Systems Development Certification course with UNO. 
This has been long pending for me, and I have been following my interests since my girl reached adolescence. 
I look forward to the Web Development course interested in learning and using the tools to develop web pages to have one on my own. 
My career interest is to become a developer, and the course, class, and my Master’s will help me pursue my career goal. </p>
 <p>

Apart from my family and studies, I am passionate about "cooking" and "gardening.” 
Since my marriage, I started cooking and slowly started learning different cuisines only after coming to the US. 
I mostly cook South Indian Cuisine, and I also have tried other Cuisine like Italian (Pastas and Pizza) and Chinese (Fried Rice Noodles).
Most of my cooking is a healthy choice, and I avoid buying from restaurants as much as possible.
Below are some of the images of the cuisines that I usually cook in my home.

Apart from cooking, I enjoy gardening. I have a small garden on my patio and a few inside my house. 
I take care of them well, and I spend my time in my garden in the summer evenings.
I plant Rose and Jasmine as Rose is always pleasant to watch, and I like the fragrance from Jasmine. 
I also grow vegetables like Tomato, Okra, Squash, Valor flat, peas, and others. 
I usually want to use my vegetables in my cooking, and I can see the difference in taste when I cook them compared to the ones 
I get from the grocery.</p>


<p>That's all about me, and I am looking forward to spending the next few months with the class.</p>
